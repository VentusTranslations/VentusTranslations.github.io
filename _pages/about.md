Hello my name is Benjamin Leister I am 20 years old and looking to work as a Translator and Interpreter, to be able to do this I have finished my A-Levels in Germany at the August-Bebel-Schule in Offenbach a.M. and continued on to the Euro Akademie Aschaffenburg, where I trained to be a foreign language correspondent in the languages German, English and Spanish.

# Personal Information

I am a generally open and calm person and I enjoy what I do. I have grown up and lived in Germany and have been practicing English since 3rd Grade. Additionally I started learning spanish when I was in 6th Grade and had my fun with it. Although I have a pretty easy time learning languages, I was never able to raise my Spanish level to measure up to my English language skills. Since I am a pretty adaptive person, I have rarely had a hard time dealing with anybody and I was always able to get along with whoever I worked with so far.
